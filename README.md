Hello fellow engineers,

I am a beginner in software engineering and have been trying to teach myself for about a year now.
I've worked with Python, C/C++, Javascript, CSS, and HTML, but I am not proficient in any of them.
My dream is to work with aerospace technologies, robotics, and AI.
So during the past year, I have been failing at grasping the concepts of code and trying to figure out how to capitalize in those industries with the resources I have.
I built a STEM robot and afterward bought a raspberry pi to further my mechanical interests with future projects.
With all this ambition, my curriculum hasn't been very efficient, so I am starting to network and find better ways to learn and practice.
